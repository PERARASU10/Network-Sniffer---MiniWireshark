# Network-Sniffer---MiniWireshark
# 🐍 Advanced Packet Sniffer (Wireshark-like)

A Python-based GUI packet sniffer built with **Scapy** and **Tkinter**, offering a real-time, user-friendly interface to inspect, filter, and analyze network traffic — inspired by Wireshark.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live packet capture and display
- ✅ Filter by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS)
- ✅ Search by IP address or port number
- ✅ View detailed packet structure
- ✅ Hex and ASCII dump of packet data
- ✅ Protocol distribution statistics chart
- ✅ Export captured packets to `.pcap` file
- ✅ Clear and reload packet table without losing data
- ✅ "Show All" button to reset view after searching

## 🔍 What's New in This Project:

✅ Suspicious Port Detection: Automatically flags traffic to common attack ports like 21, 23, 445, 3389, etc.

🧠 Beginner-Friendly Interface: Simplified GUI designed for students and learners — no clutter, no config files.

🐍 Fully Customizable in Python: Built with Scapy + Tkinter — easy to read, modify, and extend.

🔍 Real-Time IP/Port Search: Instantly filter packets based on IP address or port without losing captured data.

🧹 Clear & Reload Display: Reset the output view at any time without wiping stored packets.

📊 Protocol Statistics Pie Chart: Visual overview of TCP/UDP/ICMP/DNS usage across the session.

📦 Export to PCAP: Save captured packets to .pcap format for later analysis in Wireshark.

🚀 No External Dependencies: Runs on Python with minimal libraries — Scapy and Matplotlib only.

💡 Educational Focus: Great for demonstrating live packet capture, protocol behavior, and network inspection in classrooms or tutorials.
